1. This folder contains all the required files to produce the results of the above paper

2. Users should independently obtain the Multiple Indicator Survey Data files from NSSO, MoSPI. Because of the sharing policies, we are not giving all the raw files of the MIS.

3. However, prepared data files are provided in the folder data. These files are sufficient to reproduce the results

4. There are two do files. One is to prepare the sample, andthe  other is to produce outputs

5. Since the data folder contains two .dta files that are created after running the do file 'preparing_sample.do'
So user can avoid re-running preparing_sample.do and can directly head to 'All_analysis_of_paper.do'

6. From All_analysis_of_paper.do, users can produce all the figures and tables of the paper

7. Both code files are annotated.
